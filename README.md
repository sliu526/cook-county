## Context

We seek to examine the housing records dataset from Cook County, a cluster of neighborhoods in Chicago. In Cook County, the county assessor's office (AO)determines valuations for homes for property taxes. When done fairly, these assessments are an equitable and transparent way to determine property tax bills. However, the Cook County AO had consistently overestimated the housing prices of the lower income, working class and underestimated that of the upper class - this perpetuates a system of inequality.

Indeed, property taxes are a zero-sum game: when the rich pay less, then the poor pay more.

Appeals are given as an option for homeowners with overvalued properties, yet this process makes an already unequal system even less fair. Owners of high-priced homes are far more likely to appeal compared to owners of low-valued homes. This meant that the rich consistently appealed their housing appraisals, driving down their property taxes, whereas the poor had consistently over-valued homes without the ability to appeal.
